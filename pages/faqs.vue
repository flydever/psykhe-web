      <h2>About PSYKHE</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>How does your algorithm work?</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that your psychology - your personality - is the biggest factor that influences your personal
          style. It's why you can look at something and instantly say "that's me" or "that's not me" at a glance,
          without thinking about it too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, to provide you with fashion recommendations that feel "you", we ask you take a personality test to use
          PSYKHE. We want to capture and systemize that you-ness so that you don't have to trawl through thousands of
          products that aren't you. PSYKHE is the only shopping platform that allows for Sort by Personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are certain connections between personality and style preferences that we know exist - you've probably
          observed this among the people you know. So, we start out by recommending what we think you might like based
          on those connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, individual style preferences are very nuanced and sometimes complicated. The more you use PSYKHE:
          look at, save, tune products that you like, the more our AI will ‘get' you - just like building a relationship
          with a very good stylist.

        <h3>What is the "Big 5" model of personality?</h3>
        <p>
          There is a branch of psychology, which looks at personality: why we are the way we are. Researchers have spent
          time trying to devise the best measure of personality, and the "Big 5" emerged as the model widely considered
          to be the most robust way to describe personality differences. It is the basis of most contemporary
          personality research.
        </p>
        <p>Abbreviated as OCEAN, the test measures five scales:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>O</b>penness (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)</li>
          <li><b>C</b>onscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/disorganized)</li>
          <li><b>E</b>xtroversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)</li>
          <li><b>A</b>greeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. self-focused/competitive)</li>
          <li><b>N</b>euroticism (sensitive/emotional vs. steady/optimistic)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can score from 1-100 on each of the five scales, resulting in a score that is then grouped into High,
          Moderate-High, Moderate, Moderate-Low, or Low. No one score is better than any other, they blend together for
          your unique personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers have found OCEAN traits to be relatively stable from childhood through adulthood. So, it doesn't
          matter too much the mood you were in when you took the test. If you answered honestly, the results will be
          accurate. But if you feel you could have been more forthcoming and would like to retake the test, please do
          here.
        </p>

        <h3>Why not the Myers Briggs?</h3>
        <p>
          Although the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® "16 personalities" model has gained popularity in mainstream media,
          it isn't normally used by the scientific community. One reason is low "retest" scores; each time you take it,
          you can often receive different scores. The second reason is that reducing humanity to 16 types isn't
          realistic: we're much more nuanced than that. With the Big 5, scores from 1-100 on 5 scales yield millions of
          specific combinations.

        <h3>What about menswear &mdash; why don't you have men's fashion?</h3>
        <p>
          Training an AI to recognize style is tricky and takes some time. At present, our AI model has been trained
          based on womenswear, which we hope to do again with menswear in the near future. Those interested in menswear,
          please bear with us and take the personality test by signing up <nuxt-link to="/register">here</nuxt-link> in
          the meantime.

      <h2>Using Our Technology</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>What do the dot buttons under each product do?</h3>
        <p>
          The black and tan buttons below each product are our Tuning buttons. They can be used to fine-tune your
          product recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if we got it wrong, and you don't like something we've recommended to you, click on the tan
          button, where an x will appear on hover. Once selected, you've told your AI that you would like to see less
          products like this. (Whether it's the shape, color, fabric, print, or brand that you didn't like, over time,
          our AI will understand.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But if there is a type of product that you were recommended that you like in particular and want to see more
          of - say statement sneakers or voluminous skirts - then clicking the black dot with the tick upon hover, will
          tell your AI to recommend more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the black dot will not save the item, it only tunes your results so they're more accurate. To save an
          item in a list, you'll need to click the heart.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What if I don't love my recommendations and my AI doesn't get me? What's wrong?</h3>
        <p>
          While personality scores are a significant factor when it comes to style preferences, why you like certain
          styles, colors, brands, cuts, could be impacted by other things as well - places you've lived, social circles,
          your job, or music you like. It's complicated. It could be said that we're trying to turn fashion, and art,
          into science. And we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          We try to show you things you like, and weed out things you don't like, based on personality &mdash; which as
          a start, we believe helps a lot! But for some people, this system can initially be imperfect, which is why
          we've created tuning features so you can tweak your recommendations, and an algorithm that listens and reacts.
          Over a short time and a bit of feedback, your recommendations will improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI requires a lot of data to work really well, and we're only just launching this ambitious project in hopes
          of better understanding the science of personal style. We ask you to grow with us and give us feedback. In the
          future, we hope to also be able to measure other factors, so we can give you increasingly accurate
          recommendations, but in the meantime, you, early adopter, are our biggest asset.

        <h3>Do I need an account to use PSYKHE?</h3>
        <p>
          You cannot receive personalized recommendations from PSYKHE's AI until you take the personality test, as our
          model requires your scores to know what you might like. You can still use the filters to browse product, but
          will not be able to see personalized recommendations.

        <h3>Can I retake the test?</h3>
        <p>
          At present you can only take the test once per account. When answered honestly, Big 5 test questions are so
          general, that results have proven to be stable throughout one's lifetime. However, if you feel that you did
          not answer as accurately as you could have, we recommend you create a new account with a different email
          address.

      <h2>Shopping</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Can I shop directly on your site?</h3>
        <p>
          You cannot purchase directly on PSYKHE's website. PSYKHE is an aggregator, a fashion recommendation engine
          that allows you to shop items from global retailers all over the world. Once you click on a product's retailer
          from its product page, you will be redirected to the retailer's site to place your order. All shipping,
          delivery, and customer service matters will then be dealt with by the retailer.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Are all featured items in stock?</h3>
        <p>
          The information we have about a retailer's stock levels is updated on our system once a day. Sometimes, a
          popular product may have sold out in the meantime, for which we are sorry. We are working with our partners to
          carry out automatic stock checks more frequently.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>How do I make a wishlist?</h3>
        <p>
          You can save products on a Saved page on PSYKHE, much like on Instagram. You can save products you like and
          might want to buy on one general list, or you can create a custom list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom lists allow you to save products that you might want to get for specific purposes or occasions. For
          example, we all love creating a capsule for an upcoming trip or holiday. You can call your list by
          destination: "Miami", "Ibiza", "Palm Springs", or "Positano". Or, you can save products you are shortlisting
          for a friend's wedding, your birthday, or anything. If you're obsessed with a certain product, like camisoles
          or leather leggings, you can save by category as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, when you save something, PSYKHE's AI learns more about what you like, and your recommendations will
          become more accurate.

    <section id="faq-philosophy">
      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>What about trends - do you factor those in?</h3>
        <p>
          Sure, trends happen when something political, environmental or cultural happens in the world to shift our
          collective mindset, and so there is still a general reflective creative direction in what comes out in the
          industry, and in stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at PSYKHE, we believe that we as individuals, only respond to some trends, some colors, some shapes. We
          admire the style of only some influencers. The magic of fashion lies in these unique differences, which is why
          we try to only recommend the styles that you'll like, not every single trend.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What about body types - do you factor that in?</h3>
        <p>
          We don't want to be prescriptive about what anyone "should" wear based on their body type &mdash; ultimately,
          everyone likes different fits. We prefer to try and recommend products that you'll like based on style, and
          let you filter down silhouettes from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also proud to offer size-inclusive options through our select partners. Tick "Size Inclusive" in the
          left-hand navigation to explore.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What is your stance on sustainability?</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that self-knowledge is the antidote to overconsumption. Meaning that when you understand why you
          like what you like, when you have a deep, strong sense of what's you, which is the experience that PSYKHE aims
          to provide, you will buy better. We aim to drown out the noise, so you don't feel you should buy anything just
          because some magazine said it was a must-have. (No florals for spring, unless that's your thing.) We want you
          to only buy it if you connect with it. If you connect with it, you'll love it and take good care of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the production and supply chain side of sustainability, we are also excited to be partnering with
          retailers who have vetted brands and products that meet sustainable principles. Tick "Sustainable" in the
          left-hand navigation to explore.
