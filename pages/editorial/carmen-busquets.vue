            Fashion can slowly shape one’s identity. Looking back on your life, which style of clothes (or specific
            pieces) made you who you are today?
          </h5>

          <p>
            "I wore a lot of Montana, Mugler and Alaia in my early twenties when I entered the workforce and started
            representing important, international fashion brands. I was a lot younger than everyone else, so I felt the
            need to dress older than my age to help me look the part and be taken seriously. Later in my career, when
            dealing with men in finance I felt a need to wear a lot of black, armoresque pieces from McQueen, Galliano
            and Rick Owens as a way to shield myself and appear less approachable. I preferred to puzzle and intimidate
            men with bold outfits rather than give too much of myself away."
          </p>

          <h5>Which three brands or designers most resonate with your core personality?</h5>

          <p>
            "I always talk about having 16 eclectic, creative and somewhat clashing personalities that I need to dress.
            Some days I feel feminine, others I feel sexy, others I feel like a tomboy and fashion gives me a way to
            express the way I am feeling. While they were alive, leading their brands’ creative direction, my list would
            have included Yves Saint Laurent, Azzedine Alaia and Alexander McQueen. Now my go-to designers are Gabriela
            Hearst, whose clothes empower women and speak to my inclusive outlook and desire for all women to feel the
            best version of themselves; Rick Owens, whose statement pieces are testament to my anti-conformist
            personality; and Dries Van Noten, whose multicultural aesthetic and boho silhouettes resonates with the free
            spirited, nomadic part of me that has been traveling since a young age and finds inspiration in every corner
            of the world."

            How does being in the islands affect your personality and mood, and subsequently how does this affect your
            style, compared to the city?
          </h5>

          <p>
            "Living in the Bahamas has given me an opportunity to slow down and get closer to who I am and to my
            Caribbean roots. My body is attuned to sunnier, warmer climates which instantly translates to my penchant
            for a more relaxed style of colorful and flowing dresses. Comfort is paramount and I tend to dress in a much
            more bohemian way, walking barefoot as often as I can. "
          </p>

          <h5>Jewelry is a big part of your signature look – how does it make you feel?</h5>

          <p>
            "I see jewelry as the ultimate form of self-expression. I am a bit disconnected from planet earth at times –
            I am 60% deaf and I often chose to disconnect my hearings aids when I am in traveling in big cities – so big
            jewelry calms me and grounds me. It’s like a mantra to be present all day. I have also found it to be a
            fascinating conversation starter."
          </p>

          <h5>When you’re having a bad day, do you dress for how you feel, or dress for how you want to feel?</h5>

          <p>
            "I always dress for how I want to feel, and the sicker or sadder I feel, the more complex my outfit can get.
            I guess it is a way to conceal the way I am feeling, projecting an image in the mirror of where I want to be
            emotionally. It works."
