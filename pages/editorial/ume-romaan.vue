            Fashion can slowly shape one's identity. Looking back on your life, which style of clothes made you who you
            are today?
          </h5>

          <p>
            "Although my style is constantly evolving, I grew up with parents who had a real contemporary but pared-back
            style, and I think it has really shaped part of my own personal identity. I’ve always been someone who
            favored wearing a pant over a dress, even as a young child, and that’s something that I’ve carried with me
            into adulthood."
          </p>

          <h5>Which three brands or designers most resonate with your core personality and why?</h5>

          <p>
            "Toteme is a brand that have a really clear DNA, they create refined wardrobe pieces that transcend. I favor
            pieces that can be taken from season to season and I think that really identifies with their brand ethos.
            Similarly, House of Dagmar, a Swedish brand that creates some real classic wardrobe pieces. I also love the
            The Row, apart from being a huge style stalker of the founders growing up, their pieces are so beautifully
            made and identify with the perfect wardrobe uniform."
          </p>

          <h5>When you're having a challenging day, do you dress for how you feel, or how you want to feel?</h5>

          <p>
            "For the most part, how I feel. Comfort for me plays a huge role in how I dress and that goes hand-in-hand
            with how I’m feeling"

            You certainly have a penchant for monochrome and neutrals, but will occasionally wear a print. What mood do
            you have to be in to wear a print?
          </h5>

          <p>
            "Generally, when I’m feeling more uplifted. I rarely wear a print but when I do, I’ll favor one with muted
            tones and probably balance the look with a solid color."
          </p>

          <h5>What item in your closet do you consider to be your armor?</h5>

          <p>
            "An oversized blazer. It’s a piece I can throw over any outfit and one that can add a real edge to a look."
          </p>

          <h5>What are your top three tips for good mental health?</h5>

          <p>
            First, keeping a line of communication open, whether thats with friends or loved ones. It hasn’t been so
            easy with the pandemic but taking some time to have social contact can be so healing even if thats through a
            call or FaceTime. Secondly, good quality sleep can make you feel mentally and physically rested. And
            practicing mindfulness - whether that’s simply through breathing techniques or yoga - it can make us more
            aware of the present.
