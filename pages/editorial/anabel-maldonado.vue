                also have a work-hard, play-hard mentality. The palm tree motifs on this dress offset the ladylike

          <h5>How have your style choices played an important role in getting you to where you are now?</h5>

          <p>
            "I’ve always said that I had subconsciously dressed like the woman I wanted to be, until I really became
            her, and that fashion has helped me to grow towards my best self rather than my worst. There’s a severity to
            the monochrome ensembles I’ve worn in my twenties, it’s as if they were a roadmap to fostering the grit
            required to fulfill my potential."
          </p>

          <h5>Why do you feel it’s important for people to embrace fashion personalized by personality?</h5>

          <p>
            "Because wearing an outfit that just feels wrong for you, which usually happens because you listened to
            “noise” – what a magazine, style rules, partner, or friend suggested – can be really jarring and almost
            painful. Conversely, when you’re dressed in alignment with who you are, you feel a sense of power and
            electricity. The best way to really hone in on what’s really you is to put your style through the context of
            the building blocks of your personality – which is why we use the scientifically validated Big 5 test."
          </p>

          <h5>Flats or heels?</h5>

          <p>"Both flats and high heels. Just never a mid-heel."</p>

      <div class="cols cols-2">
        <div class="col col-1">
          <h5>What's your go-to outfit for a sartorial mood boost?</h5>

          <p>
            "Although in my day-to-day, I’m pretty casual – I am usually in a hoodie, leather leggings or shorts and
            sneakers – when I need to be bulletproof, it’s usually comes down to a good dress."
          </p>

          <h5>Does nature or nurture a more powerful effect on one's individual style?</h5>

          <p>
            "It’s always an interplay of both, but I would have to say that nature is a much stronger force. In my
            fashion psychology research, I have seen that the trait of neuroticism especially tends to have strong
            correlations with specific fashion choices, and this quality, along with the other personality traits, are
            known to be fairly steady throughout life. There is an argument for certain cultural influences, but often
            it’s also precisely your personality traits that draw you to these experiences as well. The tendency to like
            hip hop over mainstream pop or indie music. Or the impetus to move to Paris over backpacking in Asia. Your
            personality is the common denominator in all of your choices."
          </p>

          <h5>What's the psychology behind investment bags?</h5>

          <p>
            "If fashion is armor, then the handbag is a shield. We've been taught to believe that we buy investment
            pieces to make a statement to others, but what's much more important is the quality that the piece conveys
            back to you when you look down at it. When you catch that shiny gold logo gleaming back at you, it
            reinforces motivation, identity and positive self-beliefs. Not everything comes from the inside - it's an
            exchange."
