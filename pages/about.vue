            Our psychological approach to fashion helps you to shop like you’ve never been able to before. Powered by
            personality science and AI, PSYKHE is a shopping platform that recommends fashion from leading global
            retailers, personalized by your personality. This way, you don’t have to go through many different sites and
            pages, to filter and navigate through things you don’t like. PSYKHE enables you to Sort by Personality.
          </p>

          <p>
            We aim to show you things in alignment with who you are - not impersonal edits, trend-pushing, and florals
            for spring.

        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      </div>

      <p>The philosophy behind PSYKHE began with just one simple question: Why do we wear what we wear?</p>

      <p>
        Fashion is not frivolous. We realized that fashion’s visceral power runs much deeper than society gives it
        credit for, and that people’s individual style preferences are shaped by their own psychology. And so, we made
        it our mission to change how the world thinks about clothes. We believe that this type of individual
        self-knowledge is the antidote to mindless overconsumption.
      </p>

      <h5>We seek out fashion for three specific reasons:</h5>

      <div class="cols cols-3">
        <div class="col col-1">
          <span class="number">1.</span>

          <h5>To dress in alignment with who we are.</h5>

          <p>
            We believe that your personality is the biggest factor that influences your personal style. It's why you can
            look at something and instantly say "that's me" or "that's not me" at a glance, without thinking about it
            too much. On a gut level, you instantly know when a dress is you, or not-you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deep down, we can feel what aesthetic is the best visual representation of our core being. We just need to
            drown out the noise.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col col-2">
          <span class="number">2.</span>

          <h5>To shape our identity and become the person we’re supposed to be.</h5>

          <p>
            Over time, your style shapes who you become. The designs of clothes, shoes, and accessories have qualities
            that trigger things like grit, confidence, and determination in us, and help us develop in the direction
            that we seek. The reason you feel you must have something is because you know that it will help you live
            into your best self. Fashion can be a roadmap to the future.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col col-3">
          <span class="number">3.</span>

          <h5>To use clothes as therapy.</h5>

          <p>
            As legendary photographer Bill Cunningham once said, "fashion is the armor to survive the reality of
            everyday life". We’re not talking about mindless retail therapy here, but rather how the qualities that
            certain clothes have can change your mood, and give you strength during painful moments. Certain pieces can
            make you feel calmer, more focused, or more optimistic. Scientists call this proven phenomenon 'enclothed
            cognition'.

            To provide you with fashion recommendations that embody this philosophy, we ask you take a personality test
            to use PSYKHE. The Big 5 test is the most respected measure of personality in the field of psychology. We
            use it to promote self-discovery, as well as to capture and systemize that you-ness so that you don't have
            to trawl through thousands of products that aren't you. There are certain connections between personality
            and style preferences that we know exist – and we start out by using our patent-pending AI to recommend what
            we think you might like based on those connections.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, individual style preferences are very nuanced and sometimes complicated. If you like a product,
            you can save it or tick it to let the AI know you want more items like this. If you don’t like a product,
            you can click the X icon to zap it away, and let PSYKHE know you want less items like this. The more you use
            PSYKHE, the more our AI will get you. Essentially, we’re building the brain of a superstylist that knows
            everyone really well.

        <h3>Founder's Story</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="cols cols-2">
        <div class="col col-1">
          <p>
            Founder Anabel Maldonado is a Canadian, London-based fashion journalist, entrepreneur, and pioneer within
            the growing field of fashion psychology.
          </p>

          <p>
            The seed for PSYKHE was really planted when Anabel, as a kid growing up in downtown Toronto, began saving
            her lunch money to buy miniskirts in the late nineties. On some level, she realized that if she was
            foregoing pizza for clothes, they were never purely functional – something more powerful was at play.
          </p>

          <p>
            Motivated by understanding human behavior, Anabel completed a degree in psychology with a focus on
            neuroscience. After graduation, she came to London where she worked in clinical psychology, but felt a
            strong pull towards the fashion industry. She fatefully ended up working in fashion for over a decade as a
            fashion journalist, editor, and brand consultant, but was always frustrated by the industry’s repetitive
            content and impersonal focus on cyclical trends. Over time, she came full circle and started to look at
            fashion through the lens of psychology – examining why we wear what we wear.
          </p>

          <p class="content-quote">
            “PSYKHE enables you to drown out the noise and find pieces in alignment with who you are.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to understand our individual style preferences, she also began to carry out research using the
            respected ‘Big 5’ model of personality to explain aesthetic taste. Anabel then arrived at the fact that this
            framework was also the missing piece in personalization online. PSYKHE was born.

      <p>
        For her contributions to fashion psychology, Anabel has contributed to, and been featured in a number of
        international publications which include The Business of Fashion, Vogue Spain, Vogue Italia, Women’s Health,
        Medium, O The Oprah Magazine, and the Financial Times. She is a frequent guest speaker on podcasts and panels
        globally to discuss fashion psychology: a topic that has captivated fashion lovers and progressive thinkers the
        world over.
